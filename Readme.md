To begin with coursework task the assessment was to create a website with six responsive pages for the
local company or brand. I started the process by choosing company and decided to choose Artel Electronics
company which produces consumer electronics. After choosing company I started the process and made six responsible pages which are "Home", "All products", "Sustainable development", "Service", "Contact", and
"About us". Each page contains different informations as an example in first page there is information
about new and popular products in the footer links to the instagram,facebook twitter profile of company.
When it comes to all product section there I provide the cost and models of different electronic
applications. In the third sustainable development page you can see the methods that company trying
to decrease environmental impact of their business. Service page includes information about service
maintenance and quality assurance. When it comes to Contact us section here customer can leave their
comments on the products that company produce and if there urgent situations that customers want to
connect with company there is email, phone number and location of the company as well as on the map
they can see it. The last page "About us" gives info about company and achievments of company over the
years. After finishing all the pages I validated the html and css files through https://validator.w3.org & https://jigsaw.w3.org/cssvalidator in order to find errors and fix them. By the help of the
JavaScript I also added some animations. The final step was hosting a website through Netlify or Github pages and I also host the website that I created.
To conclude at the beginning of the course I had a only knowledge of HTML CSS but by doing the assessment I gained knowledge about animations and JavaScript.
